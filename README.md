# Librarian of Babel

A Chrome extension to discover English words while exploring
the [Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info) project.

## Background

[The Library of Babel (La biblioteca de Babel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel) is a short story by Jorge Luis Borges.

In the story, the author imagines a universe in the form of a library containing all possible permutations of 410-page books containing a finite character set.

A website called the [Library of Babel Project](https://libraryofbabel.info) contains an emulation of the concept of the Library of Babel.
This plugin simply highlights English words (from a relatively small vocabulary) discovered in the texts generated by that website.

This project was made simply for fun; the code has not been optimized.


## Highlight Plugin
The jQuery highlight function in use is adapted from [Bartek Szokpka's work](https://bartaz.github.io/sandbox.js/jquery.highlight.html), which is adapted in turn from [Johann Burkhard's](https://johannburkard.de/) plugin.





## Word Lists

Lists of English words used in this extension were adapted from two GitHub repositories:

- https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english
- https://github.com/dwyl/english-words
