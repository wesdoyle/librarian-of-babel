# Librarian of Babel

A Chrome extension to discover English words while exploring
the [Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info) project.

## Background

The Library of [Babel (La biblioteca de Babel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel) is a short story by Jorge Luis Borges.
In this story, the author writes about a library containing all possible 410-page books containing a finite, specific number of characters.

A website called the [Library of Babel Project](https://libraryofbabel.info) contains an emulation of the concept of the Library of Babel.
This plugin simply highlights English words discovered in the texts generated by that website.

## Word Lists

Lists of English words used in this extension were adapted from two GitHub repositories:

- https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english
- https://github.com/dwyl/english-words
